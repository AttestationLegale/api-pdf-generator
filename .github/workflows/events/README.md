# Events

This folder provides a bunch of pre-defined events for those who want to trigger locally their Github Actions (per example with [ACT](https://github.com/nektos/act)).

Seems logical but **please read the content of an event before triggering it**. Also if you modify an event, please think about the fact that someone could trigger it without reading, so don't persist sensitive values in events (like a trigger a PROD deployment).
